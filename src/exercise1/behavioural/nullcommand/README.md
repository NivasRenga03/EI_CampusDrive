# ðŸ“º YouTube SkipAd â€“ Command & NullCommand Pattern  

## ðŸŽ¯ Use Case  
Simulating a **YouTube "Skip Ad" button**:  
- Appears immediately when an ad starts  
- Remains **inactive for 5 seconds** (user cannot skip yet)  
- After 5 seconds, becomes usable and skips the ad  

This prevents premature clicks while keeping the UI consistent.  

---

## ðŸ”— How It Works with the Pattern  

- **Invoker** â†’ `SkipAdButton` (UI button clicked by the user)  
- **Command Interface** â†’ `Command` (defines `execute()`)  
- **Concrete Commands**:  
  - `NullCommand` â†’ does nothing during inactive state  
  - `SkipCommand` â†’ skips the ad after waiting period  
- **Client** â†’ `YouTubeAdDemo` (simulates ad play, wait, and enabling skip)  

---

## ðŸ’¡ Real-Life Scenario  

When a YouTube ad starts, the **Skip Ad button appears but is inactive**.  
- For the first **5 seconds**, it is bound to a **NullCommand** â†’ clicking has no effect.  
- After **5 seconds**, it is reassigned to **SkipCommand** â†’ now the user can skip the ad safely.
