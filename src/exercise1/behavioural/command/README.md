# ðŸŽ¬ YouTube Player â€“ Command Design Pattern  

## ðŸŽ¯ Use Case  
We simulate a **YouTube Player** with a simple UI that can perform actions like:  
- Play a video  
- Pause a video  
- Rewind a video  

---

## ðŸ”— How It Works with the Pattern  

- **Invoker** â†’ `YouTubeAppUI` (UI buttons clicked by the user)  
- **Command Interface** â†’ `Command` (defines `execute()`)  
- **Concrete Commands** â†’ `PlayCommand`, `PauseCommand`, `RewindCommand`  
- **Receiver** â†’ `YouTubePlayer` (executes actual video operations)  
- **Client** â†’ `Main` (binds commands to buttons and simulates interaction)  

---

## ðŸ’¡ Real-Life Scenario  

When using YouTube:  
- Clicking **Play** starts the video.  
- Clicking **Pause** stops playback.  
- Clicking **Rewind** lets you revisit an earlier scene.  

The UI buttons donâ€™t handle video logic directly â€” they delegate actions to the player through commands.  

---

## âœ¨ Benefits  
- Decouples UI controls from video logic  
- Makes it easy to extend functionality (e.g., Add FastForward, Mute)  
- Promotes reusability and flexibility
